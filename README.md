# engineering notes

These are notes about engineering at Linode, in blog format.

## Running

We use GitHub pages. For information about running sites made with GitHub pages,
see [GitHub's docs](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/).
tl;dr:

    gem install github-pages
    jekyll serve --watch
    # Navigate to http://localhost:4000
